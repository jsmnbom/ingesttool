# ingesttool

Python based tool to quickly ingest a lot of media files based on templates.

## Features
- Copy files from multiple sources
- Copy files *to* multiple sources
- Use Exif data to name files (images, etc.)
- Use FFProbe data to name files (videos, etc.)

All described with a powerful template language that supports variable substitution.


**NOTE: This is a quick tool I wrote for myself cause I wanted something robust to copy files, that named the destination based on patterns. I've been using it for a while and it seems stable, but I am not responsible for any data loss you may have**
